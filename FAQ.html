                        We offers a wide range of Family Adventures around the globe. The minimum age (for Family trips)
                        varies depending on the destination, and we has set minimum ages to ensure that the included
                        activities suit each age range. Additionally, you'll notice that some of the more adventurous
                        destinations have a higher minimum age. Please check out our Family Adventures for more
                        information.

                        tight! It can take us a couple of days to process your booking. We'll send you an update in 2 to
                        4 business days.

                        Full payment is required 56 days before departure to avoid trip cancellation.* You can view your
                        payment due date by logging into My Booking with your booking number and email address. We'll
                        also email you at least a week before the due date to give you a heads-up.

                        Due to the smaller spaces and types of activities, marine trips have some additional protocols,
                        including:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            All boats and yachts will have enhanced sanitation protocols in place in line with local
                            regulations.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            All travellers, leaders and crew must agree to any additional health screening measures on
                            board (rapid antigen testing, temperature checking, etc.). These may vary on different boats
                            in line with local regulations.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Our sailing trips are on board a sailing yacht, so living spaces, bathrooms and cabins are
                            shared with other travellers and sleeping quarters can be quite compact. This makes it
                            difficult to maintain physical distancing.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Single supplements are available for purchase on all trips if you prefer a cabin to
                            yourself.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Travellers are encouraged to bring their own snorkelling gear, if possible.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            All snorkelling gear available for traveller use/hire must be thoroughly cleaned and
                            disinfected. Travellers will be given one set of snorkelling equipment for use for the
                            entire trip.
